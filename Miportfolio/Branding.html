      Sumo is a Japanese fast-food franchise located in major cities across
      Spain. With this redesign, my goal was to preserve Sumo’s core
      values—freshness, quality, and approachability—while creating a design
      that better fits the brand’s current needs and communicates its message
      more clearly.
      <br />
      <br />
      I chose to design a logo that is simple but playful. I used a bold black
      typeface and highlighted the letter M in red to make it stand out. To
      include an illustration that felt naturally integrated with the name, I
      modified the M to look flattened and placed a sumo wrestler on top of it.
