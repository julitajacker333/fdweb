    </div>
    <p class="descripcion8">
      Sumo is a Japanese fast-food franchise located in major cities across
      Spain. With this redesign, my goal was to preserve Sumo’s core
      values—freshness, quality, and approachability—while creating a design
      that better fits the brand’s current needs and communicates its message
      more clearly.
      <br />
      <br />
      I chose to design a logo that is simple but playful. I used a bold black
      typeface and highlighted the letter M in red to make it stand out. To
      include an illustration that felt naturally integrated with the name, I
      modified the M to look flattened and placed a sumo wrestler on top of it.
    </p>
    <p class="descripcion9">
      For the merchandising, I designed a takeaway food box, stickers, and other
      items.
      <br />
      On the food box shown on the right, two sumo wrestlers are fighting over a
      piece of sushi, alongside the franchise’s name. I created several simple
      black illustrations of sumo wrestlers doing different actions. In the
      photo of the restaurant, also on the right, you can see another one of
      these drawings where the wrestler is sitting down and eating.
      <br />
      <br />
      As for the stickers, they are simple and functional. The first two feature
      the restaurant’s logo—one in a reduced version and the other with the full
      name. In the background, there’s another sticker (partially visible) that
      says Sumo, now at home, along with an illustration of a sumo wrestler
      riding a scooter.
